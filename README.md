# AI-Task-Aventus-Informatics
 The task involves building a **simple Linear Regression model** using Python to analyze the relationship between **hours studied** and **student scores**. The dataset is first loaded and explored, after which a regression model is trained to predict a student’s score based on the number of hours studied. Using the trained model, the score for a student who studies 9 hours is predicted. Finally, the dataset and the fitted regression line are visualized using a plot to demonstrate the model’s performance.
Here I used a dataset from Kaggle with same coloumn names.
